# Build Configuration File, used by the Build.sh script to configure how
# the Library is built, where it is installed, etc.  This file is used in
# combination with the build.sh script included with Decaf.  The
# values in the conf file can be overridden by a user by creating a user
# specific conf file in the user's home folder named ".activemqcpprc".
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Defines the location where the code is built and the configuration data
# is stored, this location is deleted any time that the clean option is
# passed to the build.sh script so don't set this to a directory like ./src
# DECAF_BUILD_DIR="${PWD}/build"

# Defines the install location for the Decaf library and its headers
# DECAF_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

# Defines the library directory where the Decaf library is placed.
# This is normally set to AMQCPP_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib on a 64bit Fedora OS
# for instance set this to AMQCPP_INSTALL_PREFIX/lib64 to place the 64bit
# library in the correct library dir to match the architecture.
# DECAF_LIBDIR=/usr/lib64

# Defines the location of the APR distribution you wish to build and link
# against. (Defines the value of --with-apr for the configure script).
# DECAF_APR_DIST=/usr

# Defines the location of the APR-Util distribution you wish to build and link
# against. (Defines the value of --with-apr-util for the configure script).
# DECAF_APU_DIST=/usr

# Defines the location of the CPPUnit distribution you wish to build and link
# against. (Defines the value of --with-cppunit for the configure script).
# DECAF_CPPUNIT_DIST=/usr

# Defines the location of the CPPUnit script cppunit-config is located, this
# script can tell us where everything else for CPPUnit is installed.
# (Defines the value of --with-cppunit-exec for the configure script).
